        <b>Can I book a single room?</b>
        <p>The majority of trips offer individual rooms;
          to find out if one is offered,
          see the Essential Trip Information or the trip overview page on our website.
          If so, kindly request it when making the reservation.</p>

        <b>Can we book a triple room?</b>
        <p>Depending on the type of vacation you select,
          you might be able to request a triple room.
          While you can ask for a triple room when making your reservation,
          it can't be guaranteed because of how far in advance we make our reservations.</p>

        <b>I'm travelling with a partner, can I make sure we have a double bed?</b>
        <p>If you’re travelling with a partner, just let us know you want to share a room (and a bed) at the time of
          booking.
          We can’t guarantee a double bed, but we’ll do our best to accommodate you.
          In some destinations, the option may be two single beds pushed together to form a ‘double’.</p>

          another trip or keep it as a credit for future travel.</p>

        <b>How long will it take for my refund to be credited to my credit card?</b>
        <p>Although we make every effort to process refunds swiftly, it can take 14 to 21 days depending on your bank

          If we can't accommodate you on the trip, we'll give you a full refund.</p>

        <b>When is the final due date for my trip?</b>
        <p>Full payment is required 56 days before departure to avoid trip cancellation.</p>

        <b>When i fail to made payment</b>
        <p>Oh no! We would love to assist you in planning your upcoming journey. Insufficient funds, inaccurate payment
          information,
          or problems with the internet connection can all prevent online payments through our booking engine from being
          processed.
          After reviewing the information, if your payment is still not being processed, please contact us by phone or
          live chat.</p>
